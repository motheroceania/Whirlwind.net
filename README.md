# Whirlwind.net
this is the repository version of [whirlwind.net](https://whirlwind.neocities.org/) made by **frank**. its purpose is for me to easily manage my site's pages and files through github desktop.

## about
- i code using [phcode.dev](https://phcode.dev/) desktop for real-time previewing.
- i used this [deploy to neocities](https://github.com/burned-salmon/deploy-to-neocities-template) guide to upload edits and files to my site through github.
- a queer coded this site

## extra
- you are free to look into my page's code and view how i did things/take inspo. but please **do not** rip the entire site's code and paste it into yours.
-  im still learning HTML & CSS as i go on, so things might be wonky. but i do these things for fun anyways ¯_(ツ)_/¯
