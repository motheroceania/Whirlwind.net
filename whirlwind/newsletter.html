                    <h2>Friday 26th September 2024</h2>
                    <h3>slow updates so far</h3>
                    
                      <p>hello! long time no see.</p>
                      <p>its been a busy month so far, which has pulled me from working on Whirlwind as much as i like. i have been updating quite a bit, but its only blog related entries and the <b><a href="/dashboard">dashboard</a></b> just to keep my sanity through these past insane weeks.</p>
                      
                      <p>i have been thinking of revisiting my other pages again... (webmaster, music, medialog maybe) just to get motivated again because page designing is extremely fun, but then i feel like im giving those pages way too much special treatment... either way, its been pretty dry recently.</p>
                      
                      <p>i keep swearing i'd create the pages within the creation section, but in all honesty, im not going to slave away with art for a while... since i'd rather not post art to my site until im really comfortable. that or i just don't want the pressure of making an art page. i might change my mind later on, but for now don't expect the art pages anytime soon.</p>
                      
                      <p>that aside, updates will be coming regularly again like always. creation tab will be put on hold though.</p>
                      
                      <hr>
                      <h3>future site plans</h3>
                      <p>i haven't thought of any other page ideas, so these are the only three i have at the moment.</p>
                      <h4>new pages</h4>
                      
                      <ul>
                          <li>dream journal</li>
                          <li>templates</li>
                          <li>guides</li>
                      </ul>
                      
                      <p>i dont know why, but i've been having a lot of crazy ass dreams/nightmares lately and its become so much that im thinking of making a whole dream page just to log them in detail, and i think its pretty funny. this will probably serve as a little archive of how many times i had a dream of a current hyperfixation i had.</p>
                      
                      <p>as for the templates page, one thing i like about coding is the CSS part. the DESIGNING part. so i thought i'd put all that joy into making f2U templates maybe. like what i did on spacehey, except more advanced.</p>
                      
                      <p>i think guides is pretty self-explainatory. mostly HTML/CSS tutorials/snippets i'd like to make to anyone whos interested. OR maybe something not HTML/CSS related. like idk maybe how to defuse a bomb.</p>
                      
                      <hr>
                      
                      and thats pretty much it. see ya later!
              </div>
                  
                  <div class="entry" id="two" style="margin-bottom:10px;">
                  
                    <h2>Thursday 22nd August 2024</h2>
                    <h3>webmaster page, medialog, + more</h3>
                    
                      <p>hello again. another newsletter for today since this past july/august had many things going on. a lot of updating, and a lot of procastination.</p>
                      
                      <p>ive been seeing a lot of support on Whirlwind these past days, the site's visit counter (on the main page) has already reached 600 hits...crazy. and i just rebranded the site maybe a month ago? im very grateful that people have been enjoying my site so far. the 200 followers, the nice messages on my guestbook. it makes me smile that people like my insane thoughts and creations on display. id also like to thank my neo-neighbors as well with the most amazing sites i come around to explore.</p>
                      
                     <p>that aside, one of the major updates i added is the site's <b><a href="/archive">archive</a>.</b> there you can view the site's history as well as page versions that were preserved. layout was very fun to code! sort of reminds me of MS-DOS or the Lisa Office System. </p>
                      
                      <p>i added both <b><a href="/bookmarks">bookmarks</a></b> and <b><a href="/graphics">graphics</a></b> pages that were simple to make. i didn't want to go all out on pages that hold so little, so i made them relate to the site map's layout.</p>
                      
                      <p>i remade the <b><a href="/webmaster">webmaster</a></b> page that i didn't even know WHERE the layout came from. i swear its like a visual gets hacked into my brain... <br> its inspirations looks a bit MAC OS inspired and i wanted to go for a more glossy/eco type feel.</p>
                      
                      <p>finally touched the <b><a href="/medialog">medialog</a></b> page. its layout felt outdated as hell... when my motivation for watching movies/playing games kicks back in, be on the look out for how many times ill spam that page.</p>
                      
                      <p>if you didn't notice, i updated all the page's music players cause the basic browser version had less customization. atleast to my knowledge.</p>
                      
                      <p>also i remade the <b><a href="/newsletter">newsletter</a></b> page. i thought its original layout looked like it had too much happening loooool.</p>
                      
                      <hr>
                      <h3>future site plans</h3>
                      
                      <p>not really sure what major plans i have in store besides the <b><a href="/art">art</a></b> and <b><a href="/ocs">ocs</a></b> pages i have YET to start on. <br> there is some other page ideas i'd like to try out though... i have been websurfing on other people's sites recently, so now im starting to get more inspired.</p>
                      
                      <h4>new pages</h4>
                      
                      <ul>
                          <li>art gallery</li>
                          <li>artblog</li>
                          <li>orginal characters</li>
                      </ul>
                      
                      <p>yeah i still haven't started on my art pages in the creations section, but its only because i barely have art im satisfied with to display sorry, lay easy on me please. BUUUT with having no other pages to make (besides shrines, which in all honesty isn't much of a priority to me), now leaving me with just art shit to focus on, gives me an advantage. so finally i can get around drawing again...jesus.</p>
                      
                      <p>im thinking of doing an art blog, which i think is a great idea cause i can do both things that make the cogwheels turn in my head, digital art and coding. + i need somewhere to simultaneously have fun while drawing. as fun doing digital art is, it kicks my ass fr. i never have motivation or ideas :').</p>
                      
                      <hr>
                      
                      all right thats it for now i guess. ciao!

                    <h2>Thursday 25th July 2024</h2>
                    <h3>post-hiatus, new site name,+ more</h3>
                    <img src="https://windchime.neocities.org/fountain/spring/blue_fan.gif" style="float:left;">
                    <p>hello! so i took a little 2 month break just to get my mind off of obsessively coding this site back to back and focus on other things, now the coding fixation is kicking in more than ever. so you might see me frequently updating this place to hell and back... apologies.</p>
                      
                      <p>after that break, i decided to change the site name. i wasn't fond of plastering my old username everywhere like it was some trademark (it felt pretentious, i dont know how to explain it). so i wanted to go with a name that spoke more to the site rather than have my old name be the face of it + avoid straying away from my passion project...</p>
                      
                      <p>so! i decided renaming my child whirlwind. it feels much fitting for the site and this sort of "vision" i have for it in my head. plus, its a title of one of my favorite songs by my beloved band <u>Beauty's Confusion.</u></p>
                      
                      <p>i updated the <b><a href="index">index</a></b>, and <b><a href="/main">main</a></b> pages a little bit just for fun. and created a new theme on the <b><a href="/music">music</a></b> page because woohoo frank's got a björk album to be annoying about.</p>
                      
                      <hr>
                      
                    <h3>future site plans</h3>
                      
                      <p>with that said, i have many things planned, since my brain is now packed with a shit load of ideas. though, it'll probably be hard to put it out on paper code. its like me with digital art, i have an idea but its so damn hard to convey it on the screen. wish i can copy and paste a vision on a canvas...</p>
                      
                      <h4>revamping</h4>
                      <p>one page i'd like to revamp/remake? is the <b><a href="/medialog">medialog</a></b>. i have not touched that page at ALL, and its still a wip even.</p>
                      
                      <p>another is maybe the <b><a href="/webmaster">webmaster</a></b> page but im not too sure on that one since i kind of still like the current layout.</p>
                      
                      <p>id also like to revamp the autoplay mp3 players on each page to a player that doesn't look ugly on other browsers possibly. but idk if ill find one so this shouldn't be something to be too worried about</p>
                      
                      <h4>new pages</h4>
                      <ul>
                          <li>artwork</li>
                          <li>orginal characters</li>
                          <li>links/resources</li>
                      </ul>
                      
                      <p>im still in a period of posting my art out on the web (a little self conscious im ngl...). but y'know this is MY SITE I GET TO DO WHAT I WANT so it'll be out soon. i just have to decide on how i'll display my art, sort by year, media, etc. this includes the original characters page as well</p>
                      
                      <p>i already had a link/resource page prior, but it looked a bit wonky or i felt the layout looked redundant so i scrapped it quietly...lol. thats one of the pages that'll be a breeze to complete though.</p>
                      
                      <h4>fanpages/shrines</h4>
                      
                      <p>ive been wanting to start on those damn loser shrines forever, and they will not go to waste!!!</p>
                      
                      <p>i try to make them look related to the site's overall style, but sometimes they don't look like their own seperate entity. so i like to picture some pages looking like a drastically diffrent file on a computer, but still connected to the computer in a way - and thats what i want done to the shrines! so for now im just gonna go ham on the aesthetic/design of the shrines. heres a few im thinking of:</p>
                      
                      <ul>
                          <li>björk</li>
                          <p>alt queen of all time deserves a spot on my site because without her the music page wouldn't exist (half joking). but seriously shes one of my long time favorites/inspirations so why wouldn't i make a fanpage?</p>
                          
                          <li>radiohead & maybe thom yorke as a bonus.</li>
                          <p>sorry for being a loser but i CANNOT get them out of my head, its probably the most insufferable fixation i had to date like i can feel it physically making my head hurt. this page will probably be in the help of my sibling who is also fixated on them as much as i am. so TRUST there will be a fuck TON of content on that page oh my god.</p>
                          
                          <p>and the thom page is a CONSIDERATION, because i might go off the rails and add too much info about him in the radiohead shrine when its supposed to be about the BAND not "thommy and the radios".</p>
                          
                          <li>saw</li>
                          <p>yes the movie saw, my favorite <s>comedy</s> horror. i have a big vision for that shrine because its one of my favorite horrors of all time and i have SO many ideas for it and how i want to propagate the masses.</p>
                          
                          <li>evil dead</li>
                          <p>hmm im thinking about it. if i rewatch the whole franchise cause ash williams is my patootie and end up being mental about it then that page is probably going to be produced.</p>
                      </ul>
                      
                      <hr>
                      
                      <p>alright i think thats all for now. one important thing ill be focusing on is doing what i want. ive been telling myself that this is MY place to do what i want and to not please others/worry whats on here. so if you see full on rpf bandslash one day. thats on you idk what to tell you</p>
